The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts:

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will complete a R exercises that demonstrates your ability to COmmunicate to stakeholders using the techniques learned in this lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of the Learning Analytics Workflow we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What educational issue, "problem of practice," and/or questions were addressed?

    -   

3.  Briefly describe any steps of the data-intensive research workflow that detailed in your article or presentation.

    -   

4.  What were the key findings or conclusions? What value, if any, might education practitioners find in these results?

    -   

5.  Finally, how, if at at, were educators in your self-selected article involved prior to wrangling and analysis?

    -   

Draft a new research question of guided by the the phases of the Learning Analytics Workflow. Or use one of your current research questions.

1.  What educational issue, "problem of practice," and/or questions is addressed??

    -   

2.  Briefly describe any steps of the data-intensive research workflow that can be detailed in your article or presentation.

3.  How, if at all, will your article touch upon the application(s) of LA to "understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs?"

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

In our Learning Analytics code-along, we scratched the surface on the number of ways we can communicate the data to stakeholders.

Using one of the data sets provided in the data folder, or your own, your goal for this lab is to create a Quarto dashboard. You will need to:

Create a Data Story with our current data set, or your own. Make sure to use the LA workflow as your guide to include

\- Develop a research question

\- Add ggplot visualizations

\- Modeling visualizations

\- Communicate by writing up a short write up for the intended stakeholders. Remember to write it in terms the stakeholders understand.

You can use the template in the `r-product_eamples` folder or create your own dashboard.

When complete Render this badge and also your dashboard and share with the instructor. There are two things you need to show to receive the physical Module 4 `Data Products` badge.

## Render & Submit

To receive your the Foundations Badge, you will need to render this document and publish via a method designated by your instructor such as: Quarto Pub, Posit Cloud, RPubs , GitHub Pages, or other methods. Once you have shared a link to you published document with your instructor and they have reviewed your work, you will be provided a physical or digital version of the badge pictured at the top of this document!

If you have any questions about this badge, or run into any technical issues, don't hesitate to contact your instructor.

Once your instructor has checked your link, you will be provided a physical version of the badge below!

*Complete the following steps to submit your work for review by:*

First, change the name of the author: in the YAML header at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R Markdown document to a HTML file that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues with knitting.

Finally, publish.
