![](img/teacher persona.png){width="10%"} ***As a passionate educator and emerging learning analyst, Alex Johnson has developed this interactive dashboard to discover patterns in student behaviors and academic outcomes. Alex's mission is to leverage data-driven decision-making to enhance the educational experience. By integrating quantitative data with educational theory, this dashboard aims to shed light on the factors that contribute to student success and well-being.***

### **Hypothesis 1: The Impact of Television on Academic Confidence**

We hypothesize a negative correlation between students' television consumption and their perceived academic competence. This theory posits that higher television viewing may be inversely related to students' self-assessed academic confidence, potentially impeding their engagement with the subject matter.

```{r}
#Creating the bar graph
ggplot(tv_percomp_means, aes(x = tv_category, y = mean_percomp, fill = tv_category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Average Perceived Competence by TV Watching Category",
       x = "TV Watching Category",
       y = "Mean Perceived Competence") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

This graph displays the mean perceived competence across different categories of TV watching time. From the graph, it appears that students who watch less TV (0-1 hours) have a slightly higher perceived competence compared to those watching TV for longer periods. However, this trend doesn't continue linearly; students watching 3-4 hours of TV seem to have a higher perceived competence than those watching 2-3 hours. Surprisingly, students who watch TV for 4+ hours report the highest perceived competence.

While the initial hypothesis predicted a negative correlation between TV watching time and perceived academic competence, the data suggests a more complex relationship. There appears to be no clear linear trend between TV consumption and self-assessed academic confidence across all categories. This could imply that other factors may influence the self-perception of competence or that after a certain point, the amount of TV watched does not significantly detract from a student's confidence in their academic abilities.

### **Hypothesis 2: The Influence of Interest on Academic Performance**

We hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between students' intrinsic interest in the subject and their academic performance, as measured by the proportion of total points earned in the course. This suggests that higher levels of interest in the subject matter are associated with better academic outcomes.

```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Enhanced scatter plot
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = int, y = proportion_earned)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5, color = "olivedrab") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "maroon") +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Proportion Earned vs. Student Interest",
       x = "Student Interest (1-5 scale)",
       y = "Proportion of Points Earned") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The scatter plot shows the relationship between student interest and the proportion of points earned in the course. The plot indicates a positive trend, as evidenced by the upward slope of the regression line. This suggests that as student interest increases, so does the proportion of points earned, though the spread of data points indicates variability in this relationship.

The visualization supports the Hypothesis 2, indicating a positive association between students' intrinsic interest in the subject and their academic performance. This finding aligns with educational research that links engagement and interest with better learning outcomes. It reinforces the importance of cultivating student interest to enhance academic success.

### **Overall Conclusion**

The visualizations provide valuable insights but also highlight the complexity of factors influencing academic performance and self-perception. They suggest that while student interest is a predictor of academic success, the relationship between leisure activities such as TV watching and academic confidence is not straightforward and warrants further investigation. The findings support the need for educational strategies that engage student interest and call for a deeper understanding of students' out-of-school activities and their impact on academic self-concept.
