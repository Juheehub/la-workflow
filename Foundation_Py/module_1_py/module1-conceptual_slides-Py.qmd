## Welcome to Foundations of Learning Analytics

> `Foundations of Learning Analytics` are designed for those seeking an
> introductory understanding of learning analytics and either basic R
> programming skills or basic Python skills, particularly in the context
> of STEM education research.

Interaction between Instructors and Students: Examining how students and
teachers engage through quizzes, exercises, and communication.

Administrative Data: Insights into school and teacher-related
information, providing a structural view of the educational environment.

Demographic Data: Analysis of student demographics, such as age and
gender, demographic data can be used to understand diverse learning
needs.

Student Affectivity: Focuses on the emotional and motivational aspects
of students, crucial for personalized learning experiences.

Each category plays a vital role in shaping educational strategies and
outcomes.

Digital learning environments include any set of technology-based
methods that can be applied to support learning and instruction.

According to Krumm et al, Digital Learning Environments have fueled data
intensive research in education more than any other data.

The ones we are probably most familiar with are....

Face-to-face contact between educators and students organized through
lectures, class discussion, small groups, individual seat work, and so
on. Traditional education systems are classified in different levels
UNESCO. These systems gather information on student attendance, marks,
curriculum goals, class, schedule information, and so on. Finally, it is
important to note that all these traditional systems can also use
computer-based educational systems as a complementary tool to
face-to-face sessions.

Digital Learning Systems or Computer use computers in education to
provide direction, to instruct or to manage instructions given to the
student. The global use of Internet and the application of artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques have led to today's plethora of new
web-based intelligent educational systems. Gibson and Frietas (2016)
suggest the function of technology as an active participant in data
generation is significant, as it is involved in the intricate process of
data creation. This process stems from the dynamic interplay between the
learner and the digital learning environment, as well as from the
collaborative data production by the learner, environment, and social
context. Such collaborative situations give rise to a wide range of
diverse data sources, which exhibit substantial variation. It becomes
necessary to harmonize and integrate these distinct data sources
together.

Blended ("blended learning," "hybrid learning," and "mixed-mode
instruction") combine face-to-face instruction with computer-mediated
instruction. Before COVID we saw some use but after COVID we saw an
increase in the use of Digital Learning Systems and Blended.

::: notes
Adaptive and Intelligent Hypermedia System (AIHS) - These systems
attempt to be more adaptive by building a model of the goals,
preferences, and knowledge of each individual student and using this
model throughout interaction with the student in order to adapt to the
needs of that student. The data recorded by AIHs are similar to ITS
data.

ITS - ITSs provide direct customized instruction or feedback to students
by modeling student behavior and changing its mode of interaction with
each student based on its individual model. Normally, it consists of a
domain model, student model, and pedagogical model. ITSs record all
student-tutor interaction (mouse clicks, typing, and speech).

Test and quiz system - The main goal of these systems is to measure the
students' level of knowledge with respect to one or more concepts or
subjects by using a series of questions/items and other prompts for the
purpose of gathering information from respondents. They store a great
deal of information about students' answers, calculated scores, and
statistics.

## Discussion

-   Choose one category (Interaction, Administrative, Demographic,
    Student Affectivity).

-   

    ```         
      Share an example of how data in this category can be collected.
    ```

-   Discuss the potential impact of this data on educational
    decision-making.

::: notes
In data-intensive research we might acquire data from LMS, SIS or
another source. Data maybe to big for a typical database software tools
to capture, store, manage, and analyze"

Those data are similar but different because 1. the tasks that students
are engaged in and 2. how data from those tasks are collected and stored
by the technology.

We identify four main types of data structures. - structured -
unstructured - semi-structured and - meta-data

**STRUCTURED - TAB**

Structured data is Quantitative in nature Here we see the rows and
columns nice and tidy. - data is tidy when each column is a variable,
each row is an observation, and each cell is a single value.

We typically have tidy data in Excel files or SQL databases that we can
import using the readr function or here function.

-   Tabular - relational data. Examples might include:
-   performance data (current and prior)
-   demographic data (student's ethnic and or group or disability)

Each field (variable) is discrete and can be accessed separately or
jointly along with data from other fields (variables).

**UNSTRUCTURED TAB**

Unstructured data is Qualitative in nature and includes: -
Non-Relational Data - sensor data, web logs, clickstreams, keystroke
capture data, emails, images and videos

Text Heavy relationships between nodes IE: Audio, video, dates SQL
database

\*\*SEMI-\*STRUCTURED-TAB\*\* Semi-structured data includes Qualitative
Triangular Data (uses surveys and interview answers) Semi-structured
data is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal
structure of data models associated with relational databases or other
forms of data tables.

Semi structured can also include log data.

It is a self-describing structure that contains tags examples: Social
media, JSON and XML, Social Networkdata

**META-DATA - TAB**

Not in the readings but something to think about is Meta-data
collection, such as the field dates, times and locations of photos,
videos and other structured data about data. - contexts and purposes for
why the data was collected

You can read more about the meta data standards on Canada's heritage
information network. The link is in the presenters notes.

## Discussion

What challenges arise from the different needs and priorities of these
stakeholder groups when it comes to data use and management?

<br/> <br/>

How can these challenges be addressed to ensure that data is used
ethically and effectively to improve education for all students?
